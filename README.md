### [Android Version](https://bitbucket.org/AventiumSoftworks/last-coin-game-android/downloads)

### What is the game?

* Select an amount of coins to play with.
* Choose your difficulty settings.
* Take one or two coins per round and try to force your opponent (the ai) to take the last coin.
* This version uses swing even though I hate swing. I am ashamed for not using JavaFX initially.

### How do I get set up?

* Download and run the jar. Downloads can be found on the releases tab. Requires Java 8.
